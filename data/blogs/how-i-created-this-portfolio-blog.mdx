Having a portfolio is a good way of showing the skills you have. A good portfolio not only shows your works and skills, but it also shows that you care about your work and you want people to notice it. I always wanted to code my websites by myself. Initially, it took a month to code this website as I was coding it on and off (I'm still making changes and adding new features).

Coding my portfolio from scratch is an opportunity to experiment and play with modern technologies. Initially, I was having my blog on another platform, but after some time I decided to have my blog on this website. So, in this article, I'll share How I created this Portfolio/Blog.

The technologies that I used to develop this website are **Nextjs**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Firebase**, and **MDX**. When starting this project I had a little Idea about NextJs and a good idea about Firebase.

### Design and Styling

I always liked simple and minimalistic designs, so I kept the design of the website simple and clean. Initially, I thought of writing my CSS to style the website, but since I know that the design is simple without any complex components and animations, I thought of using a CSS framework. I went with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS as it gained popularity in the last year. There was a little learning curve but that wasn't an issue. I didn't draw any sketches or design the website with any tools, I just started coding with the intention of making changes as required.

### Blog

Before building this website, I was having my [blog](https://blog.manibarathi.xyz/) in [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/)(a free blogging platform for developers), but I wanted to keep my blog alongside my portfolio. So I started looking online on how to implement a blog on a NextJs app and, I found a lot of people are using markdowns for writing blog articles. I found out about [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) which combines [markdown](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/#markdown) and [JSX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/#jsx). Essentially MDX is a file type that allows using react components with markdown, which is perfect for writing long content like blogs.

The idea is you write the content of the article in a markdown file, as shown below

```markdown
# This is the title

_This text will be italic_
**This text will be bold**

- This is a list
- Item 1
```

And libraries like [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) will take the content from the markdown file and converts that into HTML syntax

```html
<h1 id="this-is-the-title">This is the title</h1>
<p><em>This text will be italic</em> <strong>This text will be bold</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>This is a list</li>
  <li>Item 1</li>
</ul>
```

Then that HTML can be inserted into your website. And the result would look something like this

  height={408}
  alt="Markdown into Html"
/>

Some other plugins which I used alongside next-mdx-remote are

- **prism-react-renderer** - For Syntax Highlighting in code snippets. Whenever I add a code snippet in an article, this library will give appropriate syntax color highlighting based on the language used in the snippet.
  ```python
  # This is an example of how a syntax-highlighted python code would look like
  def foo():
      print('Bar')
  ```
- **grey-matter** - For parsing the frontmatter from the markdown files.
- **reading-time** - For calculating the reading time of an article.

### Message Form

I created a message form so that if any visitor wants to contact me, they can send me a message. First, the visitor logs in with their Google account. After logging in, visitors can type and send a message. I went with google login as it doesn't require the visitor to fill out a registration form. And since only authenticated persons can send a message, I can know the correct details of the people who are sending me a message and, it also reduces spammers.

I used [google authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/google-signin) provided by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to authenticate people. For storing the received messages, I used [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)(A NoSQL database provided by Firebase). For viewing the received messages, I created a separate admin dashboard.

### Tools, Resources and Inspirations

Some tools which I used are

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - To design images for articles.
- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) - To check spellings and grammar.
- [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) - To Compress images.

I took some ideas and inspirations from [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/), [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/), [Dennis Ivy](https://www.dennisivy.com/).

Finally, I deployed this site on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). I bought a domain from [Godaddy](https://in.godaddy.com/) and mapped the domain to the Vercel server, and that ties everything together. I hope you got something from this article. If you are more curious about how I coded this website, the source code is available in my [GitHub](https://github.com/mani-barathi/manibarathi.xyz).
